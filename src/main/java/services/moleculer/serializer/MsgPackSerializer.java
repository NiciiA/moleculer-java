/**
 * <b>MessagePack serializer</b><br>
 * <br>
 * MessagePack is an efficient binary serialization format. It lets you exchange
 * data among multiple languages like JSON. But it's faster and smaller. Small
 * integers are encoded into a single byte, and typical short strings require
 * only one extra byte in addition to the strings themselves. This serializer is
 * COMPATIBLE with the JavaScript/Node version of Moleculer.<br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Required dependency:</b><br>

 * compile group: 'org.msgpack', name: 'msgpack', version: '0.6.12'
